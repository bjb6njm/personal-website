# Website Launched!

Recently, I've went ahead and learned the fundamentals of the Astro framework so I could finally build the personal portfolio website I've wanted to have for a while. The source code is available on my GitHub. I expect to make a few updates and changes in the coming week, but for right now it's fully functional for my current purposes.

My next plans are to write a software renderer in C as a refresher on basic real-time rendering theory, and then transition to learning a graphics API (most likely OpenGL).

I'd also like to learn LaTeX sometime before I return to school in the Fall.

Great things to come!
