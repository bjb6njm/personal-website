I've been preoccupied for the last couple of weeks due to a need for travel and have only now found the time to update the website. I've fixed the display for small screens (including mobile) and have added a "recent web logs" display to the index page, which were the last items on my agenda for this website, for the time being.

In preparation for the software renderer I plan to write as a refresher on real-time rendering principles, I've been reviewing some basic linear algebra such as matrix operations and linear transforms, and have been giving some thought to the architecture of the software renderer. I'm planning on writing it in C, and my end goal is to essentially have a 3D graphics API that can be used to write basic software-rendered graphics programs, such as small games. I'd also like to write a couple of said demo programs as a demonstration.

Hopefully, in the coming weeks I'll have more to share regarding the renderer. I'm also thinking about working on a project in the Unity game engine on the side--unsure, currently.
